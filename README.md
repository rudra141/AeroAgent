# AeroAgent: Agentic AI for Airport Operations

<!-- Replace with your banner -->

## 🚀 Project Overview

AeroAgent is an expert-level agentic AI workflow designed to simulate and optimize airport operations. It demonstrates autonomous decision-making by AI agents for flight scheduling, runway and gate allocation, and weather adaptation, integrating predictive analytics and optimization.

## Key Highlights:

Autonomous multi-agent workflow

Predictive delay modeling using ML

Optimization of runways and gates

Real-time simulation and dashboard visualization

## 🎯 Objectives

Minimize flight delays

Optimize airport resource usage

Showcase agentic AI behavior in aviation systems

Provide a scalable and modular framework for AI-driven airport automation

## 🧩 Agentic AI Workflow
Agent	Responsibility
FlightAgent	Requests takeoff/landing, adapts flight paths dynamically
RunwayAgent	Allocates runways autonomously based on requests
GateAgent	Assigns gates and resolves conflicts autonomously
WeatherAgent	Updates system with dynamic weather changes
OrchestratorAgent	Coordinates communication and feedback between all agents

## 📊 Features

Autonomous decision-making: Each agent operates independently with inter-agent communication

Time-stepped simulation: Simulates 24-hour airport operations in real-time or accelerated mode

Predictive analytics: RandomForest / LSTM-based flight delay predictions

Optimization: MILP or RL-based scheduling for runways and gates

Visualization: Interactive dashboard showing flights, gates, runways, and alerts

Metrics collection: Flight delays, resource utilization, number of autonomous decisions


## 📈 Results / Metrics

Total flight delay reduction: X%

Runway utilization efficiency: Y%

Gate conflict resolved automatically: Z events

Number of autonomous agent decisions: N

(Replace X, Y, Z, N with your actual project results)
